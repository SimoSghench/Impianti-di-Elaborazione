# Impianti di Elaborazione

The project, titled **"Impianti di Elaborazione"**, presents a comprehensive analysis of computing system performance and reliability through a series of experiments and advanced data analysis techniques.

## Overview

The project is divided into several key chapters:

- **Chapter 1: Benchmark**  
  Conducts performance benchmarking using an Nbody simulation to compare different system architectures (e.g., a desktop vs. a laptop).

- **Chapter 2: PCA & Clustering**  
  Applies filtering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and clustering techniques to real workload data, providing insights into data reduction and information loss.

- **Chapter 3: Web Server**  
  Focuses on capacity testing and workload characterization of a web server. Experiments include throughput and latency measurements, CPU/memory utilization, and fairness index evaluation using tools like Apache2 and JMeter.

- **Chapter 4: Regression**  
  Analyzes trends in communication data through regression analysis. Both parametric and non-parametric methods (e.g., the Mann-Kendall test) are used to estimate trends and slopes.

- **Chapter 5: Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD)**  
  Presents reliability analysis using RBD and fault tree methodologies to evaluate different system configurations and predict failure times.

- **Chapter 6: FFDA**  
  Investigation of system failure modes, including fault detection and dependability analysis.
